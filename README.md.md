# Scraper

Scraptag is a Seo Analysis tool.
I don't assume any responsability for the use of this tool.
# Start the server with Node.js:
Requires npm to be installed on your pc.
Clone this repo on your pc. Open a terminal and go to the root of the repo then type "npm install".
When all the modules are installed, just type "cd scraper" and "npm start". It will run a web-server listening on http://localhost:5000/it/seo-analysis/?= followed by the url of the page you want to analyze.

# Node Modules installed:
-express
-jQuery
-axios
-cors
-cookie-parser
-http-errors
-cheerio
-stopword
# Start the client with Angular:
Requires Angular to be installed on your pc (npm install @angular/cli).
If the server is active, just type "cd progetto-web" and "ng serve". It will run a web-server listening on localhost:4200. Here you can find a bar to enter the url.
